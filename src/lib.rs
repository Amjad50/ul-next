//! A safe Rust wrapper for [`Ultralight`](https://ultralig.ht/) library.
//!
//! `Ultralight` is a library for rendering web content using the GPU, it allows
//! easy integration into games and other applications.
//!
//! There are two options to use the library:
//! - Using the [`App`] struct, which is a managed application that allows
//!   to create [`Window`]s that can contain multiple [`Overlay`]s, you can
//!   control the position and size of the [`Overlay`]s, and the inner [`View`]s.
//! - The other option is using the [`Renderer`] directly, in that case, if you
//!   want to have GPU rendering in your application you need to supply a custom
//!   [`GpuDriver`] in [`platform::set_gpu_driver`].
//!
//! This library also contain a custom [`glium`](crate::gpu_driver::glium)
//! [`GpuDriver`] implementation that can be used for easier integration.
